About

Patent2Net is elaborated and maintained (on a free base) by a small international team of professors and researchers
Patent2Net is a "free" package, dedicated to :
	augment the use of patent information in academic, nano and small firms, developing countries (all those without pay mode access)
	learn, study and practice how to collect, treat and communicate "textual bibliographic information", and automation process 
	provide statistical analysis and representations of a set of patents.
	
Patent2Net is an "open source" package and contributions are welcome.
Patent2Net is available "as it is".

First step : Train how to search patent information using interface

Install Patent2Net package
같같같같같같같같같같같같같
To run as python script need to install python libraries :
networkx, pickle, os, sys, datetime, urllib, requests, time, simplejson, json

to run as a an exe file (windows) : need to install the "full package", updating can be done only copying the "Patent2Net" files. Operate as a "Command window"

setup.py is provided also to compile binaries for your windows operating system. Use it with the command python setup.py py2exe to produce binaries in the dist directory.

Use Patent2Net
같같같같같같같	
	1 - Construct the patent list with OpsGather-PatentList.exe
	Use as : OpsGather-PatentList.exe Your_File.dump "search expression"
	For example : OpsGather-PatentList.exe test.dump "ti =(stereolithography or \"3D print*\") AND pd<=1996"
	Protect the " with a \ Should obtain at minimum as many patents as with the URL interface.
	Results are stored in the "PatentLists" directory within the dump file in pickle format.

2 - Download bibliographic data using OpsGather-BiblioPatents.exe Your_File.dump
	The result is a file with same name (bigger) stored in the "BiblioPatents" directory.

3 - download the claims (optional, not consistent at this time) : OpsGather-Claims Your_File.dump
	The dump file is the file produced on stage 2 (without path, patentlist directory is the default source)
	Available claims (mainly European Patents EP) will be downloaded and stored "claims" directory in iramutek format (http://www.iramuteq.org/)

4 - convert to gephi (gexf) file : PatentsToNet.exe Your_File.dump.
	The dump file is the file produced on stage 2 ((without path, BiblioPatents directory is the default source)
	Result is stored in "GephiFile" directory as a Your_File.dump.gexf.
	

Todo List :

	URL Links for IPC 7 and 11
	URL Links for inventors or applicant (to evaluate what they are doing out of search field, in general)
	Grouping results in Patent Family. 
	Other Gathering process list for family requests
	Susbscribed version. 
	Patent Citation
	Revisit weights.
